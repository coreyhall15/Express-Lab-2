Express Lab 2
Practice the Basics of Express




Learning Objectives
Set up some express servers for practice
make some get routes
use url/query parameters
Practice setting up express applications.
Practice creating custom routes.
Practice using parameters from a request.



Prerequisites
Nodejs
npm packages
Introduction to Expressjs
Request/response/ how the internet works basics
Basic understanding of routing
JavaScript, HTML fundamentals



Technical Requirements
Must be able run without syntax errors (ok if it breaks after the user tries to do something, though do try to comment on the code that isn't working)
Must get functionality required for each section working



Getting Started
Create a directory called express-lab-2then touch a Javascript file inside of express-lab-2called server.js.

You'll use this file to complete the exercises below:

Run npm initto create a package.jsonfile.
Install express with npm i express.

üêò Hint: You can check to make sure your installation was successful in one of the following places:

Your package.jsonfile should have expresslisted in the dependencies.
You could also check in your node_modulesfolder to see anexpressfolder.
Require expressand set the app. (look back to the lesson notes from today if you need more help on how to do this).
Tell the server where to listen for requests (the port).



Greetings
Make a route '/greeting'that sends a generic greeting to the screen like "Hello, stranger".
Give the greetingroute a param /:name
When hitting the route, the page should display a message such as "Hello, ", or "What's up, <name>", or "<name>! It's so great to see you!" (ex. hitting '/greeting/Jimmy-boy'should display Wow! Hello there, Jimmy-boyon the page).
üî¥ Commit

"Greeting express application created."



Tip Calculator
Your app should have a route of '/tip'and it should expect 2 params. One should be totaland one should be tipPercentage.
When hitting the route, the page should display how much your tip will be based on the total amount of the bill and the tip percentage. (ex. hitting '/tip/100/20'should display 20on the page).
üî¥ Commit

"Tip Calculator express application created."



Magic 8 Ball
Create a route of '/magic'that should expect a phrase in the URL that ask the Magic 8 ball a question.
So if the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" (ex. '/magic/Will%20I%20Be%20A%20Millionaire') he should have return to him his question AND a random Magic 8 ball response (see the array below) on the screen.
We can't use spaces in the url, so we use %20to express a space in the url.
So if the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" he should get his question asked and a random Magic 8 ball quote on the screen.
Send the magic 8 ball response back between html <h5>tags
Use this array of Magic 8 ball responses.....
["It is certain", "It is decidedly so", "Without a doubt", "Yes definitely","You may rely on it", "As I see it yes", "Most likely", "Outlook good","Yes", "Signs point to yes", "Reply hazy try again", "Ask again later","Better not tell you now", "Cannot predict now", "Concentrate and ask again","Don't count on it", "My reply is no", "My sources say no","Outlook not so good", "Very doubtful"]</h1>

"Magic 8 Ball express application created."



Take one Down and Pass it Around
Build an express application that enables users to count down the number of bottles of beer. Don't like beer?

Pass around bottles of soda, kombucha, or milk etc.




Instructions
mkdir pass-it-around
cd pass-it-around
npm init -y
build a basic express server



Requirements
On the home page (get "/"), users should see:

"99 Bottles of beer on the wall"
a link that says "take one down, pass it around"
this should link to /98, where the number represents the number of bottles left.
When a number is given in the url (get "/:number_of_bottles"), users should see:

The number of bottles of beer on the wall (i.e. 98 Bottles of beer on the wall.)
a link to "take one down, pass it around", where the href is number of bottles in the parameter minus 1.
If there are 0 bottles left, do not show a link to "take one down"

Add a link to start over, which directs the user back to the home page.
